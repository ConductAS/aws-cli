The goal of this project is to make it easier to manage EC2 and RDS for mulitiple AWS accounts by providing:

* Script for installation of the AWS API Tools (command line)
* Script for configuring environment variables and aliases

Prerequisites 
*************
The Amazon AWS API Tools are Java based, thus Java must be installed and JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set.

Getting started
***************

1) Install AWS API Tools by running:
bash install-aws-cli-tools.sh
(The script creates a tmp directory that can be removed when the script is completed.)


2) Create a directory to store certificates and keys for your accounts. The directory should contain a subdirectory for each AWS accounts, which should contain X.509 cert and private key (and optional ssh keys) for the respective AWS account.
$ mkdir -p accounts/account1
$ cp <dir_for_downloaded_x.509_files>/*pem accounts/account1
export AWS_CERT_ROOT=$PWD/accounts

$ find accounts
accounts
accounts/account1
accounts/account1/cert-LNEDCEVSV74CIPPYAFEWDINCTDPWRKKU.pem
accounts/account1/pk-LNEDCEVSV74CIPPYAFEWDINCTDPWRKKU.pem


3) Setup environment for a given AWS account:
. set-aws-env
(Note: only source the environment file, do not execute it.)

Example:
$ . set-aws-env account1
Setting upp EC2 and RDS for accessing the account1 Amazon AWS account.

Testing connection...
Connection OK

What next?
**********
You should now be able to run the ec2 and rds command line tools. For more information, see:
